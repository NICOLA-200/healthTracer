## Description

The Health Tracer application helps users keep track of their fitness activities.  It provides a user-friendly interface to view workout details, filter workouts by type, and search for specific workouts or users.  The application uses Angular for the frontend, PrimeNG for UI components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.  Data is currently mock data, but the application is designed to be easily integrated with a backend API in the future.

- **Search:** Enables users to search for workouts or users by name.
- **Pagination:** Implements pagination to handle large datasets of workout information.
